# Grant Opportunities

We recommend that your first action should be to initiate a [Raffle](https://ergoraffle.com/). A Raffle not only sets a clear funding target, but it also demonstrates the support of the community and can be complemented by additional grant or foundation funding.'

For large-scale projects, there are several grant programs available. You can apply for funding through the [Good Whale Fund](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues/13) or the [DarkFund0](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues/1). These platforms allow you to present your project to the community, showcasing its potential impact and importance.

Alternatively, if you prefer a direct approach or have unique requirements not suited to these platforms, you can submit your grant request directly to us by emailing our team at [team@ergoplatform.org](mailto:team@ergoplatform.org).
