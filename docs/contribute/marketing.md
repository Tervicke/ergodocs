## How Can I Participate in Community Marketing?

Ergo thrives on the dynamism of its community, which encompasses numerous sub-ecosystems and tens of thousands of Ergonauts actively engaged across various social platforms.

* Engage in active conversations on our [@ErgoSocials on Telegram](https://t.me/ErgoSocials) or the [#marketing channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/TBFXMzha7X). This is a great opportunity to collaborate, contribute ideas, and shape our community's voice.
* Contribute to the community-curated Wiki at [ergonaut.space](https://ergonaut.space/en/home). It serves as a central hub for resources and information in over forty languages, fostering accessibility and growth for Ergo's global audience.
* Make use of the [Shared Figma Graphic Space](https://www.figma.com/file/pd92vgB3xNFThaacIKodYs/Guide-ID?node-id=1%3A756) to enhance your visual content or collaborate on design projects.
* Access a wide range of graphics via our [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jionpgnj89eod2f/AAC5S1vnOwO3gm2vRYOmDBQ-a?dl=0), or visit [awesome-ergo](https://github.com/ergoplatform/awesome-ergo/tree/master/graphics/Logo) for official Ergo logos.
* Enroll in the [Sigmanaut Training Programme](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/the-sigmanauts-programme/) to actively contribute towards the growth and development of Ergo.

## Interested in Becoming a Regional Manager?

If you're passionate about starting a regional Ergo branch – running local chats, organizing meet-ups, and fostering a vibrant community – we'd love to hear from you.

Before initiating, please browse through [our existing chats](https://linktr.ee/ergoplatform) to ensure that a branch for your region isn't already established.

While we do have several paid community managers within the Ergo ecosystem, these roles are usually filled through internal promotions. If you have a knack for fostering community spirit and engagement, immerse yourself in our ecosystem, keep abreast of new product launches, and demonstrate your value within a nascent project. Your commitment could pave the way to a more prominent role within the community.
