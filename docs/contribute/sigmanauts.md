# Sigmanauts

Ergo, as outlined in its Manifesto, is a platform designed for the common man. It stands as a counter to the centralization of banking and the misuse of money. The future of Ergo lies in the hands of its users. Alex Chepurnoy, also known as Kushti, advocates for everyone to take as much control of the Ergo ecosystem as possible.

So, how can you take control of the Ergo ecosystem? Ergo, as a blockchain, has the potential to bring out the best in humanity. Its community, rapidly growing, is one of its most significant assets. This led to the creation of the Sigmanauts Program, a grassroots initiative aimed at empowering individuals to take ownership of Ergo and help shape its future.

The Sigmanauts Program is centered around community participation and contribution. Every individual has something valuable to contribute to the Ergo ecosystem. What are your strengths? What unique skills can you bring to the table? The Sigmanauts Program provides a platform for you to make a significant impact on the future of finance.

As a Sigmanaut, you will have the chance to interact with individuals who share our passion for financial privacy and decentralization. Our training program equips you with the necessary skills and knowledge to contribute to the development of the Ergo ecosystem and help shape the future of decentralized finance.

We have identified three categories of participation: Growth, Community, and Creative. If you have marketing expertise, connections to other projects, or skills that can help expand the community and attract diverse individuals, the Growth category is for you. The Community category is ideal for those interested in roles such as ambassador, moderator, or translator. If you're a graphic designer, videographer, writer, or social media expert, the Creative category is the perfect platform for your talents.

If this resonates with you, we have a [formal application process](https://my.ergoport.dev/sigcan_form.html) for becoming a Sigmanaut.

Once you're accepted into the Sigmanauts Program as a SigCAN (Sigmanaut Candidate), you'll get the chance to work with a team of like-minded individuals, showcase your skills, and make a significant impact on the Ergo ecosystem. Over time, you'll have the opportunity to become a full-fledged Sigmanaut and assume greater responsibility within the community.

Join the Sigmanauts Program today and be a part of the grassroots finance revolution. Let's build a future where everyone has the power to control their financial destiny.
