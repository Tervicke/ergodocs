### Wallet Statistics 

This graph shows the installs over time for both the Ergo Wallet (iOS/Android) and Nautilus. The Android figures are plagued with Airdrop hunters, leading to the large decreases. Focusing solely on the Nautilus/iOS stats, we can see a slow but steady rise. With the number of installs roughly doubling since January 2023.
