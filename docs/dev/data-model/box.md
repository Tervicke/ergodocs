# Box

Ergo has a *Bitcoin-like* **UTXO** transactional model: transactions spend and create one-time objects. 

We call this object a ***'box'***. 


## Overview 

- A box is an **immutable object** which can only be created or removed. 
- A box is not simply a coin; it contains data, code and registers. Even more, there is nothing in the box but registers. 
- There are four predefined registers, with monetary value, protecting script, and an identifier of a transaction that created the box.
- Because the data of the transaction that created the box is included, the box has unique contents and, therefore, a unique id. 
- Boxes are **first-class citizens** in the Ergo protocol. The active box set is authenticated via a hash-based data structure, which allows the building of lightweight full nodes (as described in [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/994)). 
- A box may have up to six additional [registers](registers.md) with typed data. A script may access its registers (as well as registers of input and output boxes of the spending transaction).
- Transactions contain both *input* and *output* boxes. 

## Example 

As an example of a *box*. We take the *proof-of-no-premine* from Ergo genesis state, which contains the last block ids from Bitcoin and Ethereum at the moment of launch, and also the latest news headlines:

## [Registers](registers.md)

A box, at the minimum, has four pieces of information.

1. The value in NanoErgs (1 Erg = 1000000000 NanoErgs).
2. The guard script (like `scriptPubKey` of Bitcoin). (aka the "smart contract.") which protects the spending of the box.
3. Additional assets (tokens) are stored in this box.
4. Creation info of the box (`txId`, the transaction identifier that created the box, along with an output index). It also contains a `maxCreation` height parameter defined by the box creator (this is not the creation height; its use is to create "payment channels easily").

**These are stored in the first four registers of the box, leaving (R4-R9) to store custom data for use in smart contracts.**

### Optional Registers 

| Register | Value |
|---|---|
| R0 | Value (in nanoErgs as Base58) |
| R1 | Guard script (Smart Contract) |
| R2 | Assets (tokens) |
| R3 | Creation info |
| R4 | Available for use |
| R5 | Available for use |
| R6 | Available for use |
| R7 | Available for use |
| R8 | Available for use |
| R9 | Available for use |


Registers must be densely packed; we cannot sandwich empty registers between non-empty ones. The optional registers can contain data of any of the following types:

- `Int`, `Long` with the usual semantics of Scala.
`BigInt` is a 256-bit integer (i.e., all computation is modulo 2^256).
- `GroupElement`, a point on the Secp256k1 curve represented in compressed format.
- `Coll[Byte]`, a collection of bytes, semantically similar to `Array[Byte]` in Scala.
- Collection of the above, i.e., `Coll[Int]`, `Coll[GroupElement]`, `Coll[Coll[Byte]]`, etc.
- A boxId is calculated based on the contents of all the registers. This boxId uniquely defines a box and can be considered equivalent to Bitcoin's (txId, vOut) pairs.

>Note that Ergo `txId` depends only on the message and not on signatures (similar to Bitcoin SegWit transactions). Hence, a txId is available even before signing. Like Bitcoin, Ergo supports chained transactions (i.e., spending of boxes with 0 confirmations).
