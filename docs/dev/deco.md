# **DeCo (Decentralised Collaboration)**


DeCo or ‘Decentralised Collaboration’  is an organic grassroots initiative that arose to fill the gap in developer resources & education. 

- DeCo teaches participants about extended UTXO and boxes, registers, ErgoScript, designing simple systems, multi-transaction systems, and more. 
- DeCo operates courses in a semester format (similar to that of a university) in order to help newcomers immerse themselves in the Ergo ecosystem on a technical level.
- They are working on a [workbook-format](https://deco-education.github.io/deco-docs/docs/intro).
