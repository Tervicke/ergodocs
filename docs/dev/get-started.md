## **Understanding Ergo**

Ergo is a next-generation Proof of Work smart-contract platform that enables new models of financial interaction, underpinned by a safe and rich scripting language (ErgoScript) and flexible and powerful Zero-Knowledge proofs (Î£-protocols). 


##### **Transactional Model**

- Ergo adopts a transactional approach similar to Bitcoin's Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO) model. In this model, transactions utilize and produce single-use entities known as a ['box'](box.md).
- Every [transaction](transactions.md) in Ergo represents an atomic state transition. This means a transaction eliminates a box from the state and introduces new ones in its place.
- The eUTXO model allows each UTXO to carry arbitrary data and to be protected by an arbitrary predicate (or [spending condition](types.md#sigmaprop)). The data can be used to represent arbitrary tokens or smart contract states.

##### **Boxes & Their Components**

- **[Registers within Boxes](registers.md)**: Boxes come equipped with multiple registers capable of holding various assets and complex [ErgoScript](#ergoscript) types.
- **[Assets in Ergo](tokens.md)**: Dive deeper into the different assets that can be held within these boxes.


Here are some introductory resources that cover these concepts.

## ErgoScript

ErgoScript is a super-simple subset of Scala, enabling clear descriptions of contractual logic that can be Turing complete. 

It is flexible enough to allow for ring signatures, multi-signatures, multiple currencies, atomic swaps, self-replicating scripts, and long-term computation.

The Account model of Ethereum is imperative. This means that the typical task of sending coins from Alice to Bob requires changing the balances in storage as a series of operations. On the other hand, Ergo's UTXO based programming model is declarative. ErgoScript contracts specify conditions for a transaction to be accepted by the blockchain (not changes to be made in the storage state as a result of the contract execution).

### Interpreters

ErgoScript has two compiler and ErgoTree interpreter implementations for the [*Sigma Language*](sigma-lang.md):

- **[Sigmastate-interpreter](sigmastate-interpreter.md)** for JVM languages, utilized by [AppKit](appkit.md).
- **[Sigma-Rust](sigma-rust.md)**: A simpler alternative for the ErgoTree interpreter and transaction tools.

### Cryptographic

Ergo has generic support ring and threshold signatures as well as a variety of cryptographic protocols via composable [sigma-protocols](crypto.md) built into the core.

Sigma Protocols (Î£-Protocols) are the foundation of Ergoâ€™s smart contracts. Their advantage is that they are composable, using simple AND/OR logic. 

When combined with a blockchain, these composable proofs enable very powerful use cases, while allowing for the implementation of sophisticated tasks that would otherwise be impossible, risky, or expensive on other platforms. 


##### **Crypto Primitives**

- **Hash**: `Sha256`, `Blake2b256`
- **Encoding**: `Base58`
- **Signing Algorithm**: ECDSA (`secp256k1`) & Schnorr 
- **Primitive Secrets**: [Schnorr Signature](schnorr.md) & [Diffie-Hellman tuple](diffie.md)
    - **[Schnorr signature](schnorr.md)**: A proof of knowledge of discrete logarithm with respect to a fixed group generator.
    - **[Diffie-Hellman tuple](diffie.md)**: A proof of equality of discrete logarithms.
- **Non-Interactive**: The proof of sigma-statements are made non-interactive with the [**Fiat-Shamir** transformation](diffie.md#fiat-shamir-transformation).
- [EIP-0003: Deterministic Wallet Standard](eip3.md)

See [this page](/dev/scs/global-functions/#cryptographic-functions) for a description of the global Cryptographic functions available in ErgoScript.

##### **Tools** 

- **[Scrypto](scrypto.md)** is a comprehensively built open-source cryptographic toolkit, specifically engineered to simplify and safeguard the process of integrating cryptography into your applications. Supporting AVL+ Trees and Batch Merkle Proof Serialization and Deserialization. 

### AVL Trees (Plasma)

**[AVL trees](avl.md)** are highly efficient authenticated data structures natively supported in Ergo. These trees offer several benefits, including the ability to authenticate data properties without accessing the entire dataset. Developers can seamlessly integrate AVL trees into their Ergo applications using one of the **[Plasma](plasma.md)** libraries.

### Multi-Stage Protocols

Multi-Stage Contracts is a technique wherein using transaction trees we can emulate persistent storage in UTXO-based systems by linking several UTXOs containing small pieces of code to form a large [multi-stage protocol](multi.md). This enables *on-chain computations*, making it possible to process parallelised actions on top of smart contracts and construct **Turing-complete** applications.
