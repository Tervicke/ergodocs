## **Understanding Ergo**

**Transactional Model**

- **[UTxO Model](#)**: Ergo adopts a transactional approach similar to Bitcoin's Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO) model. In this model, transactions utilize and produce single-use entities known as a ['box'](box.md).

**Transactions & State Transition**

- **[Ergo Transactions](transactions.md)**: Every transaction in Ergo represents an atomic state transition. This means a transaction eliminates a box from the state and introduces new ones in its place.

**Boxes & Their Components**

- **[Registers within Boxes](registers.md)**: Boxes come equipped with multiple registers capable of holding various assets and complex [ErgoScript](#ergoscript) types.
- **[Assets in Ergo](tokens.md)**: Dive deeper into the different assets that can be held within these boxes.


Here are some introductory videos that cover these concepts.

## ErgoScript

ErgoScript is a simplified subset of Scala. It's a high-level language that gets translated into a mid-level language named ErgoTree. During execution, ErgoTree is further translated into a cryptographic protocol. This unique architecture allows Ergo to seamlessly support ring and threshold signatures, along with various other cryptographic protocols, without any special core modifications.

### Interpreters

ErgoScript has two compiler and ErgoTree interpreter implementations for the [*Sigma Language*](sigma-lang.md):

- **[Sigmastate-interpreter](sigmastate-interpreter.md)** for JVM languages, utilized by [AppKit](appkit.md).
- **[Sigma-Rust](sigma-rust.md)**: A simpler alternative for the ErgoTree interpreter and transaction tools.

### Cryptographic

Ergo has generic support ring and threshold signatures as well as a variety of cryptographic protocols via composable [sigma-protocols](crypto.md) built into the core.

ErgoScript provides two elementary Î£-protocols over a group of prime order (such as an elliptic curve)

**Crypto Primitives**

- **Hash**: `Sha256`, `Blake2b256`
- **Encoding**: `Base58`
- **Signing Algorithm**: ECDSA (`secp256k1`) & Schnorr 
- **Primitive Secrets**: [Schnorr Signature](schnorr.md) & [Diffie-Hellman tuple](diffie.md)
    - **[Schnorr signature](schnorr.md)**: A proof of knowledge of discrete logarithm with respect to a fixed group generator.
    - **[Diffie-Hellman tuple](diffie.md)**: A proof of equality of discrete logarithms.
- **Non-Interactive**: The proof of sigma-statements are made non-interactive with the [**Fiat-Shamir** transformation](diffie.md#fiat-shamir-transformation).
- [EIP-0003: Deterministic Wallet Standard](eip3.md)

See [this page](/dev/scs/global-functions/#cryptographic-functions) for a description of the global Cryptographic functions available in ErgoScript.

**Tools** 

- **[Scrypto](scrypto.md)** is a comprehensively built open-source cryptographic toolkit, specifically engineered to simplify and safeguard the process of integrating cryptography into your applications. Supporting AVL+ Trees and Batch Merkle Proof Serialization and Deserialization. 

### AVL Trees

**[AVL trees](avl.md)** are highly efficient authenticated data structures that provide native support in Ergo. These trees offer several benefits, including the ability to authenticate data properties without accessing the entire dataset. Developers can seamlessly integrate AVL trees into their Ergo applications using the **[GetBlok Plasma library](plasma.md)**.

### Multi-Stage Protocols

Multi-Stage Contracts is a technique wherein using transaction trees we can emulate persistent storage in UTXO-based systems by linking several UTXOs containing small pieces of code to form a large [multi-stage protocol](multi.md). This enables *on-chain computations*, making it possible to process parallelised actions on top of smart contracts.
