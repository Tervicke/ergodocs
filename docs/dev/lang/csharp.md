# Ergo Platform Integration with C#

Although C# resources for Ergo Platform integration are limited, there are still valuable resources that developers can leverage.

### Tutorial Series

A series titled [Ergo with C# 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUuki-fAxwc&list=PLUWruihtE-HtL-JZk8Vb4Yn_H18aE3rb6) is available on YouTube. This series provides a step-by-step guide on how to interact with the Ergo Blockchain using C#.

### FleetSharp

An open-source project known as [FleetSharp](fleetsharp.md) is currently under development. FleetSharp is a sigmatype serializer/deserializer based on [Fleet](fleet.md). This tool will facilitate the process of converting data between compatible formats for communication and storage purposes.

It's worth noting that, as with any open-source project, FleetSharp is a community-driven effort. Contributions from developers experienced in C# or interested in learning more about Ergo integration are highly welcomed.

Remember, if you encounter any problems or need more detailed instructions, you can always reach out to the Ergo community. Consider joining our [`#development` Discord channel](https://discord.gg/kj7s7nb) to get assistance from experienced Ergo developers and community members.
