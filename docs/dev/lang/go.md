# Ergo Platform Integration with Go

Currently, resources for Ergo Platform integration using the Go programming language are somewhat limited. However, there's one noteworthy project available that provides a starting point for developers working with Go.

### Ergo-Golang

The [*ergo-golang*](https://github.com/azhiganov/ergo-golang) project is a promising tool for Ergo integration. As of now, the project is still in its early stages and may be considered raw. This means that while it provides basic functionalities to interact with the Ergo Blockchain, it might lack comprehensive features and may not be fully tested or optimized.

Being an open-source project, *ergo-golang* presents a great opportunity for Go developers to contribute to its development, providing enhancements, fixes, and new features.

Keep in mind that if you encounter any issues or need more detailed instructions, you can always reach out to the Ergo community. The [`#development` Discord channel](https://discord.gg/kj7s7nb) is an excellent platform to get assistance from experienced Ergo developers and community members.
