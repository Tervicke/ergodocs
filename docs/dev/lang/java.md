# Java and Ergo

For Java developers [Ergo AppKit](appkit.md) serves as a critical library for the polyglot development of Ergo Applications. It's based on the [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/), providing developers with a vast array of functions.

AppKit is essentially a thin wrapper around core components supplied by the ErgoScript interpreter and Ergo protocol implementations, both of which are written in Scala.
