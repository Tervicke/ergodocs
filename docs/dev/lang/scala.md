# Scala Development with Ergo

Ergo's primary language is [Scala](https://www.udemy.com/course/rock-the-jvm-scala-for-beginners/). Similarly, the scripting language used by Ergo, *[ErgoScript](ergoscript.md)*, is also based on Scala.

If you're new to Scala development with Ergo, the [Ergo Scala Skeleton App](https://github.com/dav009/ergo-scala-skeleton-app) is a great place to start.

## Learning Resources

Here are some tutorials, guides, and explanations to help you get started with Scala development on Ergo:

- [ErgoScript](ergoscript.md): Learn about ErgoScript, Ergo's scripting language.
- [AppKit](appkit.md): Discover how to use Ergo's AppKit to develop applications.
- [Ergo Tutorials by Zackbalbin](https://github.com/zackbalbin/ErgoTutorials): A collection of tutorials for Ergo development.
- [Learning Ergo 101: Development Workflow](https://blog.cryptostars.is/learning-ergo-101-development-workflow-aa17dd63ef6): A guide to the development workflow for Ergo.

## Development Resources

Here are some resources that can assist you in your Scala development journey with Ergo:

- [Sigmastate-Interpreter](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter): This is an ErgoScript compiler and ErgoTree Interpreter implementation for Ergo blockchain's *Sigma Language*. For the development of Ergo applications using JVM languages, consider using [Appkit](#appkit).
- [ScoreX](https://github.com/scorexfoundation/scorex): An open-source, modular blockchain & cryptocurrency framework.
- [Scrypto](https://github.com/input-output-hk/scrypto): An open-source cryptographic toolkit designed to make it easier and safer for developers to use cryptography in their applications. It's based on Scorex and used internally in [Ergo Node](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo) and [ergo-wallet](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/tree/master/ergo-wallet).
- [Ergo Scala Style Guide](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-scala-style-guide): Follow this guide to maintain consistency and readability in your Scala code.
