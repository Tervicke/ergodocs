# Scrypto: A Comprehensive Cryptographic Toolkit

[Scrypto](https://github.com/input-output-hk/scrypto) is an open-source cryptographic toolkit designed to simplify and secure the integration of cryptography into your applications. It provides a range of features to facilitate secure data handling and verification.

## Key Features of Scrypto

- **AVL+ Trees**: AVL+ Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. They provide efficient and secure access to your data, ensuring optimal performance and data integrity.

- **Batch Merkle Proof Serialization and Deserialization**: This feature allows for the efficient confirmation of the integrity and authenticity of your data transactions. It enables the serialization and deserialization of Merkle proofs in batches, enhancing the speed and efficiency of data verification processes.

Scrypto is built upon the foundation of [Scorex](https://github.com/scorexfoundation/scorex), a modular open-source platform known for its robust blockchain and cryptocurrency frameworks. By leveraging Scrypto, developers can access powerful and reliable cryptographic functionalities, minimizing the risks associated with such implementations and enhancing the security of their applications.
