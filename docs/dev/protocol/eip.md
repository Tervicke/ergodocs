# Ergo Improvement Proposals (EIPs)

Ergo Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are a set of guidelines and standards designed for the continuous improvement of the Ergo Platform. These proposals encompass a wide range of aspects, including but not limited to, core protocol specifications, client APIs, dApp/contract standards, and more.

Here are some of the EIPs that have been proposed and implemented:

- [EIP-0001: UTXO-Set Scanning Wallet API](eip1.md): This EIP focuses on extending the wallet to serve the needs of external applications by providing a flexible scanning interface.
- [EIP-0020: ErgoPay](eip20.md): An interaction protocol between wallet application and dApp for creating, signing and sending Ergo transactions.
- [EIP-0037: Tweaking Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm](eip37.md): This EIP proposes changes to make the current difficulty readjustment more reactive and smoother.
- [EIP-0027: Emission Retargeting Soft-Fork](eip27.md): This EIP proposes an amendment to the emission schedule to ensure the long-term sustainability of the mining protocol.

To gain a better understanding of the structure and formatting of EIPs, we encourage you to review the existing [EIPs](https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips). This will provide you with a clear picture of the expectations and standards associated with EIPs.
