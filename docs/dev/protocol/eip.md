# Ergo Improvement Proposals

Ergo Improvement Proposals (EIPs) specify and/or describe standards for the Ergo Platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, dApp/contract standards, and other such things.

Please check out existing [EIPs](https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips) to understand the general expectation of how EIPs are supposed to be formatted.
