# NiPoPoW Sidechains

Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NiPoPoWs) are a novel technology that enables trustless sidechains. They leverage [***Simplified Payment Verification***](modes.md) (SPV) proofs to provide resistance against potential attacks, while maintaining a small enough size for efficient network transmission.

Previous proposals for "compact SPV proofs" have shown vulnerabilities to certain attacks, particularly those that could allow miners to illicitly acquire funds from the sidechains.

In essence, NiPoPoWs offer significant utility for sidechains. They allow for the integration of two or more separate chains without necessitating changes in the other chains. This integration eliminates the need for mechanisms such as "Wrapped Tokens," which are dependent on DAO governance.
