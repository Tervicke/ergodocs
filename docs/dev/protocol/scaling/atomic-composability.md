# Understanding Atomic Composability in Blockchain Systems

## The Role of Atomic Composability in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

In the realm of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), the power of open-source allows for the integration, modification, and reuse of decentralized applications (dApps). This ability to combine and reconfigure components is known as composability, and it significantly enhances the value of the overall ecosystem. A specific form of composability, known as atomic composability, is particularly crucial for certain DeFi applications. Atomic composability ensures that all related transactions either execute in their entirety or not at all, a feature vital for operations like flash loans and instant arbitrage. However, certain scaling solutions, such as sharding and Layer 2 platforms, can introduce complexities that may disrupt atomic composability.

## Balancing Scalability and Atomic Composability

The challenge for blockchain technology lies not only in achieving scalability but also in maintaining atomic composability at scale. Ergo addresses this challenge by optimizing the use of resources within the constraints of existing blockchain platforms, rather than resorting to unproven technologies.

## The Impact of Scaling Solutions on Atomic Composability

Scaling solutions typically involve partitioning the platform into smaller sections, such as shards, or adding a new layer atop the base layer. However, if these solutions are not implemented correctly, they can disrupt the smooth interaction between assets and applications across different sections of the platform.

### The eUTXO Model and ErgoScript

The [eUTXO](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/utxo/) model, in conjunction with the ErgoScript smart contract language, allows for the atomic execution of complex, [multi-stage transactions](multi.md) within a single transaction. This ensures that all components of a transaction are executed in full or not at all, a fundamental aspect of atomic composability. ErgoScript enables the creation and execution of complex smart contracts with predictable outcomes, while leveraging the benefits of the UTXO model, such as statelessness, improved parallelism, and reliable data handling.

### Layer 2 Solutions: Hydra State Channels

Layer 2 solutions, such as [Hydra state channels](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/hydra/), also contribute to atomic composability. Hydra facilitates communication across different heads, allowing for the atomic execution of complex operations involving multiple state channel participants.

### ACE: Enhancing the Execution of Complex Smart Contracts

Ergo's ability to execute complex and composable smart contracts could be further enhanced by implementing concepts like [ACE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/835.pdf). ACE suggests decomposing smart contracts into smaller, concurrent tasks that can be executed independently, thereby improving overall performance and throughput. It allows one contract to safely invoke another contract executed by a different set of service providers, facilitating off-chain execution of interactive smart contracts with flexible trust assumptions and enhancing atomic composability.

## Sharding and Its Impact on Atomic Composability

### An Overview of Sharding

Sharding is a technique that divides a blockchain network into smaller sections, or shards, to enhance scalability. Each shard processes a subset of transactions independently. However, maintaining atomic composability, where all components of a multi-step transaction are executed in full or not at all, can be challenging in a sharded environment.

### Strategies for Preserving Atomic Composability in Sharding

Several strategies can help preserve atomic composability when implementing sharding:

#### Cross-shard Transactions

Establish a mechanism for secure and efficient communication between shards to enable cross-shard transactions. This mechanism ensures that all components of a multi-step transaction are either fully committed or rolled back, even when the transaction spans multiple shards.

#### Locking Mechanisms

Introduce locking mechanisms to prevent double-spending and fraud during cross-shard transactions. Temporarily locking the assets involved until the transaction is complete can help preserve atomic composability.

#### Two-phase Commit Protocols

Employ [two-phase commit protocols](layer2.md) to coordinate cross-shard transactions. In the first phase, shards tentatively execute the transaction and lock the relevant assets. In the second phase, once all shards have confirmed the transaction, it is committed, and the locked assets are released. If any shard fails to confirm, the transaction is rolled back, and the locked assets are released.

#### Optimistic Execution

Allow shards to optimistically execute transactions, assuming dependencies between shards are resolved. If conflicts arise later, the transaction can be rolled back, and the network can learn from the conflict to prevent similar issues in the future.

#### State Channels or Sidechains

Use state channels or sidechains to process transactions off-chain, settling the final state back on the main chain. These off-chain solutions enable complex, multi-step transactions without directly involving multiple shards, thus preserving atomic composability.

These strategies offer a general framework for preserving atomic composability in a sharded blockchain environment. The specific implementation details would depend on the requirements and design of emerging dApps.
