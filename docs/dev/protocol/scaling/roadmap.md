# Ergo Scaling Roadmap

Join our discussions on scaling on [Telegram](https://t.me/ErgoLayer2) or [#layer2 on discord](https://discord.gg/nr4JRnhAyV). We welcome all insights and contributions.

## Current Focus

With the successful integration of UTXO set snapshots and Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NiPoPoWs) for ultra-fast bootstrapping in the pruned full node, our focus has now shifted towards optimizing this implementation. We are also exploring ways to further increase block limits for miners, given the live status of the pruned full node.

## Recent Developments

- (TBA) Planning for Node V6 & scalability improvements
- (WIP) Development of SPV Client
- Pruned Full Node is [now live](pruned-full-node.md)
- Release of [Node V5](jitc.md)
- GetBlok released the [Plasma Library](plasma.md)
- Plasma Tutorials have been published

> Starting to design things. I think better to start from foundations. Ergo was designed as commodity money (digital gold) with programmability (even more, possibility for crypto contracts, like stealth addresses, arbitrarily complex signatures, mixing schemes and so on),to be a basis for unstoppable (by banksters or "regulators") grassroot economies, these days can be thought as cbdcs for the people (while cbdcs for large scale governments do not have sense imho). Initial experiments are going well considering the motivation.

> Now it is time for scaling and adoption. Which needs in the first place for defining adoption, as this term does not really mean anything concrete in most conversations in the space I've witnessed.

>  Then p2p level optimizations and rework, with considering options for pre block commitments to tx ordering (sub blocks), while increasing tps securily significantly as well. There are limits here anyway as there is requirement to have flat p2p network run on commodity hardware (not banksters' datacenters). Thus at the same time options for offloading transactions to l2 or sidechains also should be proposed (if not implemented). [KYA](kya.md) was in particular introduced to explain offloading options security in concise and understandable fashion.

>  Thus few developments are going to converge.
