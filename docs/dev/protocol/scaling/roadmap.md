# Scaling Roadmap

For discussions on scaling please join the [Telegram](https://t.me/ErgoLayer2) or [#layer2 on discord](https://discord.gg/nr4JRnhAyV)

## Timeline

Currently, our focus is on integrating UTXO set snapshots and Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NiPoPoWs) to achieve ultra-fast bootstrapping. This approach will provide a fast sync with the same level of security as if they had processed every block since genesis. Upon successful stabilization of this implementation, we advise miners to contemplate increasing block limits once more.

- (TBA) Node V6 Planning & scalability improvements
- (WIP) SPV Client
- (WIP) Bootstrapping with UTXO Set
- [Node V5](jitc.md) released.
- GetBlok release [Plasma Library](plasma.md)
- Plasma Tutorials released.
