# Unified Transactions

In the Ergo Platform Blockchain, transactions play a crucial role in facilitating various operations within the network. This section provides an overview of unified transactions, highlighting important aspects such as the fee structure and the absence of out-of-thin-air emission in the "coinbase" transaction.

## Fee as Boxes

When conducting transactions on the Ergo Platform Blockchain, fees are represented as boxes. Boxes are fundamental units that store and transfer value within the blockchain. They encapsulate different types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, tokens, or other digital representations of value.

To ensure the smooth functioning of the network and incentivize miners to include transactions in blocks, users must attach an appropriate fee to their transactions. This fee is represented as an output box, which is created alongside the other outputs of the transaction.

By attaching a fee box to a transaction, users indicate the amount they are willing to pay for the processing of their transaction by miners. The fee serves as a reward for miners, encouraging them to validate and include the transaction in the blockchain.

## Absence of Out-of-Thin-Air Emission in the "Coinbase" Transaction

The "coinbase" transaction, also known as the generation transaction, is the initial transaction in each block that rewards the miner for successfully mining and adding the block to the blockchain. Unlike some other blockchain protocols, the Ergo Platform Blockchain does not allow out-of-thin-air emission in the "coinbase" transaction.

Out-of-thin-air emission refers to the creation of new coins or tokens during the coinbase transaction, without any previous inputs or transactions. In the Ergo Platform Blockchain, all coins or tokens in circulation must have originated from a valid source and be accounted for in the transaction history.

By disallowing out-of-thin-air emission, Ergo ensures the integrity and scarcity of its native cryptocurrency, Erg. This design choice enhances the security and economic soundness of the blockchain, making it resilient to inflationary practices.

The unified transaction model in Ergo enables users to attach fees as boxes, incentivizing miners and contributing to the network's sustainability. Additionally, the absence of out-of-thin-air emission in the "coinbase" transaction strengthens the security and integrity of the blockchain's native cryptocurrency.
