This innovation allows for the performance of complex and privacy-sensitive tasks without intermediaries, fostering a trustless environment with unparalleled application-level privacy. It's a testament to Ergo's commitment to creating an intelligent, user-friendly blockchain platform where security and accessibility go hand in hand.

### Secure and Accessible to All

Ergo's dedication to making blockchain security universally accessible is evident through its implementation of Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work [(NIPoPoWs)](nipopows.md), which allow users to transact and verify with confidence without the need for a full node. This feature, requiring as little as 1 MB of data, ensures that Ergo's benefits are accessible on virtually any device, further democratizing blockchain use. Additionally, Ergo addresses blockchain sustainability through [Storage Rent](rent.md), incentivizing efficient data storage, and the [eUTXO](eutxo.md) model, which enhances privacy, scalability, and interoperability, solidifying Ergo's position as a secure and inclusive platform.

### Commodity Money and Innovation

Ergo transcends the traditional concept of a blockchain token, embodying **commodity money** with real-world consumption of resources like electricity and hardware wear and tear for mining new ERG. This approach is rooted in the practice of securing commodities with cryptography, a path first paved by Bitcoin. However, Ergo distinguishes itself with features that have remained unique for over four and a half years since its mainnet launch, including:

- Incentives for long-term stability within the mining sector.
- The implementation of [demurrage](storage-rent.md), reinforcing the notion of Ergo as a genuine commodity by incurring ledger maintenance costs.
- Support for decentralized derivatives and DeFi, enabling users to lend ERG, convert it to stablecoins, etc., without third-party intervention.
- Introduction of SigmaFi ([SigmaFi](sigmafi.md) bonds and others), a peer-to-peer DeFi solution offering comprehensive risk assessment across the network, surpassing transparency and risk management capabilities of traditional financial institutions.
- Ergo offers unparalleled support for developing [cryptographic protocols](cryptographic.md) as applications, including [non-interactive mixers](mixer.md) and [stealth addresses](stealth.md), enhancing privacy and security.
- As a platform for contractual money, Ergo excels in leveraging cryptocurrencies for real-world applications by establishing money with well-defined trust assumptions. Further discussions and insights can be accessed at [Ergo Forum](https://www.ergoforum.org/c/community/high-level-discussions/12).

Ergo's recognition as the leading Proof of Work (PoW) cryptocurrency in terms of supply locked in DeFi underscores the practical application and benefits of its features, demonstrating that its innovative solutions extend beyond theoretical concepts.

Through meticulous integration of these new insights, the narrative now fully captures Ergo's comprehensive and pioneering approach to blockchain technology, highlighting its unique strengths and contributions to the field.

By extending Bitcoin's contract-writing method, Ergo attaches a guard script and additional custom data to each coin. This feature positions Ergo as a uniquely beneficial platform for Contractual Money.

**With these features, Ergo is poised to redefine the concept of Contractual Money.**

## The Genesis of Ergo

Launched in 2019 by a cohort of esteemed developers and cryptocurrency luminaries, including Alex Chepurnoy and Dmitry Meshkov, Ergo emerged from a shared vision to revolutionize the blockchain landscape. This initiative aimed to craft a supremely efficient, secure, and user-friendly platform for financial contracts, leveraging the transformative potential of blockchain technology. The inception of Ergo was driven by the recognition of a pressing need for a decentralized platform that could securely and efficiently handle the complexities of digital financial contracts, foreseeing the pivotal role of DeFi across various sectors.


### A Fair Start

From its inception, Ergo was dedicated to ensuring a fair and equitable launch, reflecting the foundational principles of Bitcoin to prevent undue influence from venture capitalists or large-scale investors. This strategy aimed not only to democratize access but also to establish a sustainable economic model for the network's growth. The mining protocol was designed to allocate a portion of the rewards to a treasury, managed by the non-profit Ergo Foundation, to support ongoing development and adoption efforts. In its first 2.5 years, the Foundation accumulated 4,330,791.5 ERGs, or about 4.43% of the total supply, with a focus on promoting Ergo's widespread use. For more information about the role and initiatives of the Ergo Foundation, please visit [here](ergo-foundation.md), and for more details on emission, see the [emission](emission.md) section.

Highlighting the strategic absence of venture capital in its early phase underscores Ergo's dedication to community-led governance and the preservation of decentralization as its core ethos. This model promotes a truly decentralized blockchain environment, where the community's interest and the platform's integrity remain paramount.



- **Fixed Supply:** Ergo has a fixed supply of 97,739,924 coins. This fixed supply combats inflation by preventing the arbitrary creation of new coins.
- **Extended Emission Schedule:** Through EIP-27, Ergo's mining rewards are extended for approximately 17.38 years, enhancing the platform's sustainability. As a result, $ERG is becoming more scarce and valuable over time.


## Why Ergo Embraces Proof-of-Work?

Ergo utilizes the [Autolykos](autolykos.md) Proof-of-Work protocol, a testament to our commitment to decentralization and fairness. Proof of Work, a protocol with a proven track record of security, enables a user-friendly environment where lightweight clients can interact directly with the blockchain, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This approach is pivotal in creating a truly programmable currency that is accessible and ready for use today.

### How Does Ergo Address Bitcoin's Challenges?

Ergo is designed to address several key challenges that are inherent to Bitcoin, enhancing the functionality, security, scalability, and privacy of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The table below presents a comprehensive comparison between the issues faced by Bitcoin and the innovative solutions proposed by Ergo. These solutions involve advanced smart contract functionality, improved network security, efficient data structures for light clients, robust privacy tools, and scalable governance mechanisms. These improvements are geared towards creating a more inclusive and versatile blockchain platform.

| Challenges Faced by Bitcoin                                                                                                                               | Ergo's Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Limited smart contract functionality                                                                                                                      | A rich language (ErgoScript) combined with the eUTXO model, Sigma protocols and transaction chaining (for turing completeness)                                                                                                 |
| Unclear network security as the block reward subsidy approaches zero and transaction fees remain low and volatile                                         | More revenue from transaction fees due to DeFi and higher usage/scalability, storage rent, mining by subpools of tokens issued on Ergo (providing even more security incentive)                                                |
| Lack of economy around state leading to miners receiving no compensation for holding the UTXO set in high cost memory - this is a big obstacle to scaling | Storage Rent provides additional rewards for miners while increasing network security. It also compensates miners for long-term holding of the UTXO set, thus allowing larger state growth and (indirectly) larger block sizes |
| Inefficient merkle tree data structure leading to inefficient light clients (Ethereum has the same problem)                                               | AVL trees leading to drastically more efficient light client verification, and thereby allowing the use of commodity hardware to verify transactions. This is also used in Plasma (layer 2 on Ergo built by Getblok.io)        |
| Weak and cumbersome optional privacy tools, some of which have been compromised                                                                           | Sigma protocols enable true peer to peer privacy. ErgoMixer is the only token-mixer that can provide better anonymity than Monero given enough utilisation.                                                                    |
| Massive scaling challenges which led to the âBlocksize Warsâ                                                                                              | Decentralized on-chain governance based on extensive research - block size can be increased securely. NiPoPoWs enable light clients with full node security guarantees. Ergo offers more Layer-2 options than Bitcoin.         |

### How Does Ergo Address Ethereum's Challenges?

The Account model of Ethereum is imperative. This means that the typical task of sending coins from Alice to Bob requires changing the balances in storage as a series of operations. On the other hand, Ergo's UTXO based programming model is **declarative**.

ErgoScript contracts specify conditions for a transaction to be accepted by the blockchain (not changes to be made in the storage state as a result of the contract execution).

| Challenges Faced by Ethereum                                                                                                                              | Ergo's Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Creating transactions and utilizing smart contracts requires paying fees in ETH and maintaining an ETH balance, thereby leading to a poor user experience | Babel Fees on Ergo allow the user to pay the transaction fee in whatever native tokens they have in a wallet                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
