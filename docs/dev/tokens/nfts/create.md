# NFTs

The quickest way to create an NFT is to use [ergoauctions.org](https://ergoauctions.org/#/auction/active?type=all)


## On-chain NFT

> This method is not yet included in [EIP-0004: Asset Standard](eip4.md) - [See discussion](https://discord.com/channels/668903786361651200/940209605299036170/942656843619106827)

The first [on-chain NFT](https://ergotokens.org/#/?token=eba6ac4ee7f63f05659450271f6f34ec31f05e8251aea90ead36ae69ce28d82a). This is done by converting the data into Data URI and then encoding it into `R9` register. There are no limits for the size of a register, however no limits for registers, just the entire box itself
