# Creating an NFT

> The quickest way to create an NFT is to use the [resources](#Resources) listed at the bottom of this page. 

## Standard

The standard for artwork issuance on Ergo is [EIP-0024: Artwork Contract](eip24.md). This standard outlines the process of issuing NFTs, including the two different design versions, [V1 and V2](v1v2.md), and the importance of artist identity. V2 offers more flexibility and features, such as handling multiple royalty recipients, detailed artwork traits, and additional information.


## Creating an NFT programmatically

See [this page](nft-examples.md) for some simple examples that demonstrate how to programmatically mint a NFT on the Ergo Blockchain.
