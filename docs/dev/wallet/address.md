# Addresses

Addresses are short strings that correspond to specific scripts and are used to protect a [box](box.md)

Rather than storing a single amount (like BTC), an ergo [eutxo](eutxo.md) box has some [registers](registers.md) to store arbitrary values, like its [native tokens](tokens.md).

So, each box has an ERG amount and may or may not have a bunch of `{tokenid, token amount}` pairs, all in the UTXO model.

Unlike account-based models like eth, ergo tokens are *native* and are not smart contracts.


## Base58

Unlike a (hex-encoded) binary representation of a script, an Ergo address use a `Base58-encoding` and therefore has some advantageous characteristics which the binary representation does not offer:

* We can quickly check the integrity of an address via an integrated checksum (a "small-sized datum derived from a block of digital data to detect errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage", according to Wikipedia).
* A prefix of the Address shows you the network and address type. In particular, the network prefix prevents you from mistakenly sending mainnet tokens to the testnet Address.
* The Address uses an encoding (namely, Base58, as mentioned) that avoids similarly-looking characters and is friendly to double-clicking and line-breaking in emails.
* An address encodes network type, address type, checksum, and enough information to correspond with particular scripts.

Let's look at the prefix byte, which contains information about the network and address types:

## Possible Types

Possible network types are:

* Mainnet - `0x00`
* Testnet - `0x10`

Address types are (semantics described below):

* `0x01` - Pay-to-PublicKey(P2PK) address
* `0x02` - Pay-to-Script-Hash(P2SH)
* `0x03` - Pay-to-Script(P2S)


For an address type, we form content bytes as follows:

* **P2PK** - serialized (compressed) public key
* **P2SH** - first 192 bits of the Blake2b256 hash of serialized script bytes
* **P2S**  - serialized script (this is where mining rewards go!)

For example, 

- Sending 10 ERG to a **P2PK** address usually means that a corresponding transaction will contain a box in which 10 Ergs are locked by a public key encoded in the **P2PK** Address. 
- Similarly, in the case of a **P2S** address, the box will be locked by a script encoded in the Address. 
- In the most complicated case of a **P2SH** script, the box will be protected by a special predefined script that takes the first 192 bits of *Blake2b256* hash value for a script shown by an input spending the box. 

Here are some examples of the various types of addresses you'll see on the testnet: 

* **P2PK** (`3WvsT2Gm4EpsM9Pg18PdY6XyhNNMqXDsvJTbbf6ihLvAmSb7u5RN`)
* **P2SH** (`rbcrmKEYduUvADj9Ts3dSVSG27h54pgrq5fPuwB`)
* **P2S** (`Ms7smJwLGbUAjuWQ`)

And here is how what they look like on the mainnet:

* **P2PK** (`9fRAWhdxEsTcdb8PhGNrZfwqa65zfkuYHAMmkQLcic1gdLSV5vA`)
* **P2SH** (`8UApt8czfFVuTgQmMwtsRBZ4nfWquNiSwCWUjMg`)
* **P2S** (`4MQyML64GnzMxZgm, BxKBaHkvrTvLZrDcZjcsxsF7aSsrN73ijeFZXtbj4CXZHHcvBtqSxQ`)

> Note: **P2S** can start with any number, D, M, or any other of base58. `9` is always a **P2PK** address on the mainnet.

## Summary

* **Prefix byte** = `network type + address type` 
    * (for example, P2S script on the testnet starts with `0x13` before Base58)
* **checksum** = `leftmost_4_bytes (blake2b256 (prefix byte || content bytes))`
* **address** = `prefix byte || content bytes || checksum`

## Address validation

[ergo-simple-addresses](https://github.com/kushti/ergo-simple-addresses) contains few zero-dependencies Java-friendly utils for working with addresses. The [Integration Guide for Exchanges](guide.md) may also be relevant. There is also a simple method in [Fleet](https://github.com/fleet-sdk/fleet/blob/master/packages/core/src/models/ergoAddress.ts#L164). 

- **P2S** has no limit since it is the serialized script.
- **P2SH** is 192 bits since it is the "first 192 bits of the Blake2b256 hash of serialized script bytes."
- **P2PK** length is fixed. You can use the [linked class](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/blob/9e19c13d82966eaee59433d16c4fb987bea363a7/lib-impl/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/impl/OutBoxBuilderImpl.scala#L66) to validate an address (it gives a runtime exception when created from an invalid string). 

In P2S, everyone can see the script; in P2SH, the script will be known when it will be spent.

P2SH has `0x12` at the beginning, and P2S has `0x13` on testnet and `0x02` and `0x03` on mainnet accordingly (note that in hex, you can see that, but in base58, it can change to anything).

## P2S vs P2SH

**Typically most people use P2S because it is a lot easier to use. P2SH means you have to keep the contract ready off-chain to be submitted when you create the transaction, and if you lose it, then your funds are stuck forever.** This also makes it harder for other people to use your dApp as they need the contract themselves, rather than just the address. P2SH is technically cheaper since you store less data on-chain, but likely we won't see anyone using P2SH until we start to get heavy load on-chain.
