# Blitz TCG

Blitz breaks free from traditional TCG factors through a few key traits: allowing players access to their entire deck, implementing a chess-like time bank system, and adding NPC alternatives to the game board.

Our goal is to create a digital TCG that mixes iconic aspects from several game genres together to create
a refreshing alternative to standard TCG gameplay

Self-Funded. No presale. Gameplay First. Play and Earn, not Play to Earn. Ergo and Cardano.
