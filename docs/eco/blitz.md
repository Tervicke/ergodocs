# Blitz TCG

Blitz TCG is a highly anticipated gaming project that is building on top of Ergo. It breaks free from traditional TCG factors through a few key traits: allowing players access to their entire deck, implementing a chess-like time bank system, and adding NPC alternatives to the game board. The team has an extremely detailed whitepaper and is posting consistent development updates on Twitter.

Our goal is to create a digital TCG that mixes iconic aspects from several game genres together to create a refreshing alternative to standard TCG gameplay. Self-Funded. No presale. Gameplay First. Play and Earn, not Play to Earn. Ergo and Cardano. 

## Game Mechanics

For many competitive players, one virtue of gaming remains desired: consistency. In TCGs, this is the ability for a player to predict how their strategy will affect the state of a match, given the chance of drawing a specific card within a given number of turns. Some might compare consistency to fairness, specifically the minimizing of the chance a player will win or lose based on luck. Blitz TCGâ€™s goal is to limit RNG (Random Number Generation) as much as possible and promote skill/strategy based gameplay.
