# Rosen Bridge: The Future of Cross-Chain Asset Transfers

[Rosen Bridge](https://rosen.tech), an open-source protocol, is pioneering the future of cross-chain asset transfers. It's currently in beta, testing its first bridge to Cardano. Rosen Bridge leverages Ergo's capabilities to facilitate secure and efficient coin and token transfers between Ergo and other blockchains.

## Key Features:

- **Multi-Layer Security**: Rosen Bridge is safeguarded by two distinct layers of security, ensuring robust protection against potential exploits.
- **Smart Contract Reduction**: It minimizes the need for smart contracts on bridged chains, thanks to Ergo's secure hub.
- **Architecture**: The bridge's architecture includes Watchers and Guards. Watchers monitor blockchain activities and report to Guards, who then process these events and execute actions, ensuring a high level of security and functionality.
- **RSN Token**: The Rosen Token (RSN) is integral to the bridge's operation, serving as a sybil resistance mechanism, a fee distribution system, and a means to access bridge services.
- **Scalability and User Safety**: The design accommodates new chains through independent modules and prioritizes user transaction success by waiting for sufficient confirmations.
