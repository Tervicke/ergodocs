# Rosen Bridge

[Rosen Bridge](https://github.com/orgs/rosen-bridge/) is an ergocentric bridge currently [beta testing](https://soft.rosen.tech) it’s first bridge to Cardano. 

Rosen Bridge enables sending and receiving coins and tokens between Ergo and any other blockchain with supporting multi-signature transactions or threshold signatures.

There is no need to utilize smart contracts on the other chains since the consensus on any action can be performed on Ergo. This acts as an inherent security feature, making cross chain transactions significantly more resilient to attempted exploits and bad actor attacks.

For more informative and in-depth exploration of the technological features of the Rosen Bridge, please see the following [article](https://ergoplatform.org/en/news/Ergo-Launches-Rosen-Bridge-to-Cardano/) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsiy-yPJQ6w&ab_channel=ErgoPlatform).





## More Info

Joseph Armenio has described the [Rosen Bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsiy-yPJQ6w&ab_channel=ErgoPlatform) (00:10) as “a trustless Ergo-centric second layer authentication bridge.” Armenio also goes on to state (00:32) that “the end goal of this bridge is not to be fast, but to be secure.” The main use case of the Rosen Bridge is to send and receive coins and tokens between Ergo and any other blockchain (Cardano at this moment). There will be no need to utilize smart contracts on other chains as the consensus will be performed on Ergo. 

The beta user interface is currently live at soft.rosen.tech. At the moment, the Rosen Bridge is only available for private testing. Bridge security and token distribution need to be tested to be sure the bridge is working as intended. Once testing is complete and devs are satisfied with the bridge’s security, the bridge will be made available to the public.

**_DISCLAIMER - Do not use the Rosen Bridge to send ANY tokens at this time. Once the security of the bridge has been thoroughly tested, it will be made available for public use. Until that time, any funds transmitted will be lost._**
