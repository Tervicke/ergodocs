# Rosen Team

The Rosen team currently includes 8 full-time developers and 2-3 part-time developers. Some frontend and UI tasks are outsourced. The team is further bolstered by the support of several advisors.

Rosen Bridge is entirely self-funded, with no private sales, venture capital, or SAFT agreements involved, with all contracts being financed out of pocket as there is no emission yet. The core team consists of 6 main developers.

Initial liquidity for Ergo, accounting for 5%, was deposited on the Spectrum LP. There were no bots or front-running involved. (See the [Tokenomics](rosen-tokenomics.md) section)

We collaborated with Zengate for Catalyst, as it involves Cardano politics, an area that falls within their realm of expertise.

We have successfully completed and received funds from milestone 3 and have submitted milestone 4 for F10 funding.
