# Rosen Bridge: Connecting Cardano, Ergo, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain

The Rosen Bridge enables seamless interaction between the Cardano, Ergo, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain blockchains. This bridge doesn't facilitate direct swaps between native tokens. Instead, it allows users to convert:

- ADA into rsADA on the Ergo blockchain
- ERG into rsERG on the Cardano blockchain
- BTC into rsBTC on both Ergo and Cardano blockchains
- ETH into rsETH on both Ergo and Cardano blockchains
- BNB into rsBNB on both Ergo and Cardano blockchains (Soon!)

This functionality opens up new possibilities for token holders across these ecosystems.
