# Rosen Bridge: Connecting Cardano, Ergo, and Bitcoin

The Rosen Bridge enables seamless interaction between the Cardano, Ergo, and Bitcoin blockchains. This bridge doesn't facilitate direct swaps between native tokens. Instead, it allows users to convert:

- ADA into rsADA on the Ergo blockchain
- ERG into rsERG on the Cardano blockchain
- BTC into rsBTC on both Ergo and Cardano blockchains

This functionality opens up new possibilities for token holders across these ecosystems.

## Supported Tokens

| Token | Description | Network |

| ERG   | Native Ergo token | Ergo |
| ADA   | Native Cardano token | Cardano |
| BTC   | Native Bitcoin token | Bitcoin |
| [SigUSD / SigRSV](sigmausd.md) | Ergo stablecoin and reserve | Ergo |
| RSN   | Rosen Bridge token | Ergo |
| [COMET](https://thecomettoken.com/) | Ergo ecosystem token | Ergo |
| SPF   | Spectrum Finance token | Ergo |
| Hosky | Cardano meme token | Cardano |
