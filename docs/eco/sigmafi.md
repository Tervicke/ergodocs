# SigmaFi 

[SigmaFi](https://sigmafi.app/) is an open-source P2P DeFi bond market currently in beta testing.

Sigma Finance is a set of decentralised financial contracts which leverage the eUTXO model to allow for easy-to-use P2P DeFi. All SigmaFi contracts are open-source and free to build upon. Developers are encouraged to view and learn from the contracts to help build more advanced DeFi applications in the Ergo ecosystems. SigmaFi implements many different real-world financial instruments and agreements.
