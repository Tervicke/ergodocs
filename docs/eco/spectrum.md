# Spectrum

[Spectrum](https://spectrum.fi) can provide more functions than Ethereum based DEXes and [has more possible features](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-06-ergodex-model-amm-and-order-book-type-exchange/) such as limit orders, partial filling, and buy-back supports. Ergo’s Multi-Stage Contracts allows for timed release payments, so a code implemented in the contract can help investors to cancel their order with a minimal loss if the developers of the project don’t deliver their promises. With the implementation of NIPoPoWs, DEX will be interoperable in both PoS and PoW blockchains. Users can enjoy the freedom of exchanges with self-custodial wallets.



The [ErgoLabs](https://github.com/ergolabs) repositorty contains all the related code for Spectrum.
