# The Ergo Foundations Future

## Initial Role of the Ergo Foundation

The Foundation's role was to bootstrap the Ergo ecosystem in the initial years and build up the infrastructure required for adoption, solving the 'hard side' of Ergo and leading to the vibrant ecosystem we see today with:

## Achievements

- 300+ community devs
- 100+ Active contributors in the weekly developer chat in Discord. 
- Hosting multiple [events](events.md) per year. 
- 140+ projects are developing on Ergo. See [sigmaverse.io](sigmaverse.io) for an overview!
- Consistently ranked in the top 100 for development activity on [artemis.xyz](https://app.artemis.xyz/developer-activity?ecosystemValue=Ergo)

## Strategic Approach

The Ergo Foundation, while it may continue to exist indefinitely as a legal entity, primarily serves to mitigate counterparty risk in interactions with centralized entities.

In another capacity, the Foundation could persist as a research division, fostering the development of applications and protocols that align with its foundational objectives: promoting blockchain technology for societal benefit, advocating for truly decentralized infrastructure, and upholding privacy as a fundamental human right.

The optimal strategy involves diligent work and the development of robust infrastructure to accommodate potential liquidity shifts from existing systems. Emphasis should be placed on user security, privacy, and long-term resilience.

While the timing and nature of these shifts cannot be precisely predicted or controlled, strategic positioning can prepare us for various outcomes.

The generous contributions from ecosystem projects to the Foundation's [treasury](treasury.md) ensure its sustainability, enabling it to fulfill its mission until such time as it becomes redundant.


## The Sigmanauts Programme

As time goes on, the importance of the EF should diminish and shift towards the community entirely. This is essential for both the strength of the ecosystem and ensuring that Ergo is not classified as a security. 

The [Sigmanauts Programme](sigmanauts.md) was launched at the start of 2022 to fill this need and build the required structures to pass the baton to the community. Now with a funded treasury and begining to test out Paideia, you can submit proposals for how they should spend it on [ergoforum](https://www.ergoforum.org/c/marketing/sigmanauts-treasury/35)
