# Ergo Foundation Treasury

The Ergo Foundation initially received an allocation of 4,330,776 ERG, which is equivalent to 4.43% of the total supply. A significant portion of this Treasury has been expended for the benefit of the protocol and the community. Even during periods of low ERG price, the Foundation continued to invest in order to foster and grow the Ergo community. Additionally, several projects that launched on Ergo have generously allocated a fraction of their tokens to the EF Treasury.

     {type: question, open: true}
Please note that the majority of these funds are currently illiquid. We distribute a small portion of SPF to cover some development expenses from the grants awarded (as detailed below), but we are cautious to avoid exerting any downward pressure on a project that is still maturing. This situation, however, presents an opportunity to significantly augment our expenditure once we reach a stage where these tokens can be freely utilized.

## Historic Spending

The Ergo Foundation has spent the majority of the Treasury for the benefit of the protocol and community. Funds were even spent when the ERG price was low, as it was necessary to bootstrap the thriving community Ergo now boasts.
