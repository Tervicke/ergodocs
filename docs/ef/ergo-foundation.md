# The Ergo Foundation

The Ergo Foundation is a community-led organization with a focus on the following areas:

- Encouraging the non-breaking development of the Ergo Platform protocol;
- Advocating for the widespread adoption and use of the Ergo Platform and its native token (ERG);
- Fostering the growth of the ecosystem around the Ergo Platform;
- Promoting the use of the Ergo Platform and blockchain technology for societal benefit;
- Supporting truly decentralized infrastructure;
- Upholding privacy as a fundamental human right.

## Members

The members of the Ergo Foundation primarily serve as multi-signature guards, voting on proposals to allocate treasury funds in line with the Foundation's mission.

He serves as a strategic advisor to the Ergo Foundation Board and a business developer for IOHK.

## Ergo Foundation Personnel

The Ergo Foundation is made up of a diverse group of individuals, including salaried employees, volunteers, bounty collectors, and independent project developers within the Ergo ecosystem. It's important to note that there is no designated 'core' development team. The Core Marketing team, for instance, is a mix of dedicated community members and salaried professionals. Similarly, contributors who have made significant additions to core repositories may be invited to participate in Core Development discussions, regardless of their employment status.

The current composition of our full-time personnel is as follows:

- **Ergo Foundation**: Two members receive a salary for their contributions to the ecosystem, while two others are compensated with a modest amount of ERG. Both kushti and Justin choose not to receive any compensation.
- **Marketing**: Four individuals are compensated for their efforts. Further details can be found in the [marketing](#marketing) section.
- **Development**: Three individuals are salaried, with additional contributions being covered by [bounties](bounties.md).

A detailed breakdown of our expenditure can be found in the [Treasury](ef-treasury.md) section.

## Scope

The primary focus of the Ergo Platform is to provide an efficient and secure way to implement financial contracts, which is the most widely used application of blockchain technology. This focus is recognized and supported by the Ergo Foundation.

The Ergo Foundation is committed to organic and non-breaking development of the Ergo Platform protocol. The Foundation ensures that protocol changes are approved not only by miners - who express their will directly on the blockchain - but also by users and projects building on top of Ergo. 

The Ergo Foundation is committed to maximizing the number of valuable ecosystem developments accomplished in open-source with the least permissive license possible.

The Foundation is also dedicated to helping with building trustless environments, smart contracts and payment frameworks for the public with privacy in mind. The Foundation believes that the Treasury should be distributed mainly to the community, including freelancers, hackers, experts and enthusiasts. 

### Infrastructure

- Support for protocol research, development of the reference client, alternative clients (if needed),  libraries, and developer tooling. 
- Improving market access by getting Ergo on centralised exchanges, hardware wallets, bridges, or other means.

### Education

- Creating materials to educate developers and users directly or funding their creation through third parties from within the community. 

### Marketing

The Foundation aims to promote the adoption of Ergo. While its operations in this area are conservative, it does fund a select few roles in linear marketing for areas not currently met by the community.

The current paid roles within marketing consist of 

- Manager,
- Youtube Manager,
- Editor,
- Writers (via paid bounties),
- Chinese Marketing Manager,
- Branding Advisor.

Their efforts ensure ample information is available about ongoing developments on Ergo via blog posts and social media, as well as the promoting and operating of various marketing events, such as Ergo Summit and ErgoHack.

Over the past 23 years, network effects have accounted for approximately 70% of the value creation in tech, and this figure is likely higher for a third-generation grassroots blockchain. While the EF strives to lay the foundations and help ignite community marketing and, subsequently, compounding growth, beyond this, the marketing and promotion of Ergo rest principally on the shoulders of the community. [(Get Involved!)](contribute.md)

The EF does not commonly pay for influencers or ad campaigns and does its best to restrict frivolous spending, which is deemed not cost-effective  (i.e. airdrops, giveaways).

The marketing department highlights projects building in the ecosystem. However, these initiatives do not constitute an endorsement from the Ergo Foundation. The Foundation will always use best practices to vet projects and ensure that there is no risk for potential users. Still, in the early stages of development, it is often unknowable if anything of substance will ultimately be produced.

### Relationship to Development

Relationships between the Foundation and development only exist when there is a demand not met by the community, and this role is diminishing over time. Some EF members also have developer positions, and while their development activities are not part of their foundation involvement, they are listed here for transparency. 

- Kushti manages any bounties relating to the reference client repository and keeps a watch over [sigma-rust](sigma-rust.md) development and any other high-level development and research not covered below.
- Morphic manages any JVM-related developers (Wallet devs, Scala devs, etc.) and the [sigmastate-interpreter](sigmastate-interpreter.md). 
- mhs_sam manages a team of graduates and PhD students who have produced [Ergo Raffle](ergoraffle.md), [ErgoWell](ergowell.md), [Minotaur-wallet](wallets.md), and [Rosen Bridge](rosen.md). 

### Activities

The average day-to-day for foundation members is mostly organisational, dealing with exchanges, market-makers and our internal accounting & budgeting. As well as overseeing the following activities:

- Salaries for contracted developers.
- Paying 'bounties' set on core repositories.
- Core protocol development.
- Wallet development.
- Exchange listings.
- Paying third parties for admin and miscellaneous expenses.
- Partnership-related expenses.
- Hackathon and summit-related expenses.
- Marketing and promotion-related costs. 

### Code Audits

The Ergo Foundation does not review or endorse any code specifically. Code reviews are sometimes performed by Ergo Foundation members (due to their expertise in this area), but this does not constitute an endorsement, and users should be aware of their assumptions when interacting with experimental DeFi protocols. (See - [*Know Your Assumptions*](kya.md))

## The Ergo Foundations Future

The Foundation's role was to bootstrap the Ergo ecosystem in the initial years and build up the infrastructure required for adoption, solving the 'hard side' of Ergo and leading to the vibrant ecosystem we see today with:

- 300+ community devs
- 100+ Active contributors in the weekly dev chats
- 45 Hackathon participants in 2022 alone.
- 140+ projects are developing on Ergo.
- Consistently ranked in the top 100 for development activity on [artemis.xyz](https://app.artemis.xyz/developer-activity?ecosystemValue=Ergo)

As time goes on, the importance of the EF should diminish and shift towards the community entirely. This is essential for both the strength of the ecosystem and ensuring that Ergo is not classified as a security. 

The [Sigmanauts Programme](sigmanauts.md) was launched at the start of 2022 to fill this need and build the required structures to pass the baton to the community. Now with a funded treasury and begining to test out Paideia, you can submit proposals for how they should spend it on [ergoforum](https://www.ergoforum.org/c/marketing/sigmanauts-treasury/35)

The Ergo Foundation will likely exist for some time yet, and it may exist in some form for perpetuity as a legal entity to take counterparty risk when dealing with centralised actors.

Alternatively, it could continue to exist as a research branch to encourage the development of applications and protocols which adhere to its original goals of supporting blockchain technology for social good, truly decentralised infrastructure and privacy as a basic human right. 

The best course of action is to grind and build infrastructure for when liquidity leaks or flees existing systems. Focus on user security assumptions, privacy and longer-term non-fragility. 

Not something we can necessarily force, time or predict, but we can position ourselves.
