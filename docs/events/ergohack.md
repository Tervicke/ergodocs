# ERGOHACK

We host regular ERGOHACK events where developers come together on the [Ergo Discord](https://discord.gg/qxdrHM2eHv) for a few days (or weeks!) to hack solutions to problems. These events usually centre around a theme, although not strictly enforced.

There are no entry requirements, and all are welcome! Even if you have an idea sharing it in the #icubator-form on Discord may pique some interest.

##  Events

### ERGOHACKVII

#### Light node with Satergo

Satergo wallet now facilitates the configuration of light nodes. These nodes can leverage NiPoPoWs, UTXO set snapshots, or both. Light nodes provide a more user-friendly entry point for potential node hosters due to their faster sync times and lower disk space requirements. The final report is accessible [here](../events/pdf/ergohackvii/light_node_with_satergo.pdf).

#### SidechainProto

The [ergohack-sidechain](https://github.com/ross-weir/ergohack-sidechain) project, initiated during ErgoHack VII, investigates the implementation of sidechains on Ergo. The project's whitepaper can be found [here](https://github.com/ross-weir/ergohack-sidechain/blob/main/docs/whitepaper/sidechain.pdf).

#### Lilium: Event Ticketing

[Lilium](lilium.md) is a decentralized platform for minting and distributing NFTs on the Ergo blockchain. Initially aimed at artists for large-scale NFT sales, Lilium has expanded its functionality to include event ticketing. The final report is available [here](../events/pdf/ergohackvii/ErgoHack%207%20Final%20Report%20-%20Lilium.pdf).

There is a [shortened version of an interview by chief sigmanaut qx() with MGpai and LGD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpo415IOHro). The topic of this part of the conversation was their ErgoHack VII entry, Lilium Ticketing, a system that utilises the power of the Ergo blockchain for NFT ticket verification.

#### Atomic Swap: Web Interface

[Analog Ergo](analog-ergo.md) is nearing its test-net launch. The project's main objective is to integrate Atomic Swap smart contracts into user-friendly peer-to-peer GUIs. During ErgoHack VII, a [web UI](https://github.com/dzyphr/AtomicAnalogSwapWebsite) was added. The final report can be found [here](../events/pdf/ergohackvii/AnalogErgoErgoHackTextPresentation2023.pdf).

#### ergsnap (Metamask Integration)

[ergsnap](https://github.com/nautls/ergsnap) has successfully integrated Metamask Snap, enabling Ergo to be loaded directly onto Metamask. This integration can enhance the user experience for cross-chain activities such as atomic swaps and bridging. The final report is available [here](../events/pdf/ergohackvii/Metamask%20Integration.pdf).

#### Hodlbox

Hodlbox is a unique platform that encourages long-term holding of Ergo (ERG) by offering users the opportunity to purchase "treasure chests" with varying locking options. The locked amount can range from 10 to 10,000 ERG. These funds remain locked for a specified duration, either two years or until the value of ERG reaches $20. This mechanism provides an incentive for users to resist impulsive selling and promotes the practice of long-term holding in the Ergo ecosystem. 

As an added bonus, users receive NFTs corresponding to the amount they lock, allowing them to showcase their commitment on their profile pictures. 

Here's a simple breakdown of potential returns on investment (ROI) when ERG reaches an all-time high (ATH) of $20:

- 100 ERG locked could yield $2,000.00
- 1,000 ERG locked could yield $20,000.00
- 10,000 ERG locked could yield $200,000.00

Tim Ur, one of the project's contributors, encourages active community engagement and collaboration within the Ergo ecosystem, highlighting the educational value and potential advantages that such initiatives can offer to the community.

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SavonarolaLabs/hodlbox-xyz)

#### ReputationSystemTeam

[ReputationSystemTeam](https://github.com/jossemii/ergohack-vii) has initiated the development of a comprehensive reputation system for the Ergo blockchain. This system is designed to assign reputation scores to various entities, which can include UTXOs within Ergo, as well as external objects such as addresses, URLs, and Git repositories. The reputation system is built upon the concept of reputation trees, which are sets of UTXOs, with the root UTXO holding 100% reputation. The team is committed to further development and refinement of this system.

You can access the final report [here](../events/pdf/ergohackvii/REPUTATION_SYSTEM.md)

#### Ergo Poor Man's Wallet

The Ergo Poor Man's Wallet, also known as [EPMW](https://github.com/epmw/epmw/), is a project that aims to provide a simple, DIY, and cost-effective hardware wallet solution for Ergo cryptocurrency. The wallet is designed with affordability in mind, with the total cost of components and shipping to Europe estimated to be around $10.

#### Auction Coin

[Auction Coin](auction-coin.md) is an example of 'Degen Finance' ([DegFi](degfi.md)) operating on the Ergo blockchain. It uses a smart contract to automatically issue and auction tokens, with a game-theoretic mechanism that allows for speculative plays around token buybacks. It exemplifies how transparent, yet high-risk, DegFi can be.


### ERGOHACKVI

> **See the Final Reports [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Mgh5G1IFukXgnbG6APzHoDa7ynV7T27)**

#### Analog-Ergo

Cross-chain P2P atomic marketplace

> The basic idea is to use the cryptographic primitives available in atomic swaps as a basis for creating a cross-chain peer to peer marketplace, where Ergo users can list their own price for their own coins. Not only will this enable users to potentially earn arbitrage as a reward for liquidity on different blockchains, but they will also be able to set and agree to the value parameters for this at their own discretion in a highly private and fungible way. That means no intermediaries are involved in the transfer which also reduces any potential fees on both sides.

#### Ergo Stats

> The goal of this project is to support DeFi on Ergo with providing useful information such as blockchain statistics – currently found on ergo.watch and tokenJay - in a compact form on a mobile device

- [Submission paper](pdf/ergohackvi/ErgoStats-iOS-app.pdf)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/ach2swift/ErgoStats)

#### Ergode

> Create an Ergo node that runs natively on smart devices such as TVs, fridges, mobile phones, watches, etc. This will be achieved by targeting Tizen OS, Samsungs open source mobile operating system and done in a way where it should be easily portable to other platforms such as WebOS (LG smart TVs).

> Currently there isn't a lot of light client based messages on the P2P layer of Ergo so this project aims to test viability of running nodes on smart devices without much functionality. At least connecting to a few peers and performing handshakes/probing for peers, etc.

> At the end of ErgoHack VI the goal is to have a node running natively on a real Samsung TV and displaying basic network information.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/ross-weir/ergode)

#### Lithos

> The Lithos team will use ErgoHack VI to show off work done on the collateralization
side of the Lithos Protocol. Given that the topic of this Hackathon is CypherPunk Finance, we hope to showcase a safe, effective way to gain yield on ERG while also helping to decentralize the Ergo blockchain.

> Our goal is to create the contracts necessary to allow for collateralized mining pools which interface with the rest of the Lithos protocol. In addition, we plan to show a mockup UI which will allow for lenders to collateralize their ERG. Collateralized mining pools serve as the first half of the Lithos protocol, and are essential in allowing for completely decentralized block production on the Ergo blockchain.

> Moreover, collateralization is a safe way to gain yield on ERG with minimal risk involved. We hope that our work on collateralized mining pools will allow for greater participation in Ergo’s DeFi ecosystem, while also helping the blockchain itself.

#### Riadne Hlady2

> We are building a multisig token swapping service. It is mainly meant for users who want to swap their NFTs on Discord and want a trustless escrow service to perform the swap. Everything should happen in a single transaction, so no sending to a smart contract that the user does not understand is needed.

- [single-tx-swap.com](https://www.single-tx-swap.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/danieloravec/ergo-token-swap)

#### Privacy Guide

Privacy Fundamentals Course

> My proposal is to create an online module that teaches users about the importance of privacy and how to maintain a safe, private online experience. The module will include written materials, video demonstrations, and a step by step guide that users can follow to create and use the Ergo blockchain privately. After completing the module, users will have an anonymous wallet and know how to use it without compromising their privacy. The course may end up on YouTube or a free learning management software like Coursera. This course will be 100% free for users.

#### Perma Ergo

> Perma-Ergo is a realfi project that seeks to employ Ergo blockchain technology in holistic natural systems known as: Permaculture or Agroecology, through means of giving micro loans to farmers who neither have access to either farmlands nor the financial means to give them accessibility to land to cultivate, forming a vicious cycle spiraling to exclusion and poverty. Eventually the end goal of Perma-Ergo is to encourage: Real World Food Production Decentralisation

#### Explorer UI

Improving the ergo explorer experience.

- [Submission paper](pdf/ergohackvi/Improved_Ergo_explorer_UXUI.pdf)


#### Open Board

(Withdrawn) Pin-board concept

> OpenBoard's core idea is letting authors pin a few boxes of text, publicly available on the blockchain, and uncensorable unless all Ergo node's IP addresses are blacklisted. It would consist of an app fetching available pins from an Ergo node to display locally, and an easy
way to update one's own pins with a transaction.

> So life got in the way and I'll be travelling during most of the ErgoHack. I'll definitely keep working on OpenBoard, but as a regular small project and not within this Ergohack's timeline.

#### [EIP38-Partial-Voting](https://github.com/WilfordGrimley/eip38PartialVoting)

This EIP proposes modifying how parameter identifiers are communicated in the extension section of block headers, such that in addition to miners being able to vote for or against a change, they can vote partially in support of a change (for indicative voting). This will enable mining pools to pass along true governance power to their miners when combined with a method for miner voting within a pool (such as GetBlok's proof-of-vote)."

#### SNISP

**SNISPs** are *Succinct, Non-Interactive Share Proofs* which will allow for **accurate and efficient calculations of performed work on the blockchain**.

These proofs can be applied to any PoW blockchain. They should allow for the creation of decentralised mining pools with better security assumptions than alternatives like P2Pool, and better scalability than ETH-based SmartPools. They may also be used for other applications which involve measuring performed work (such as direct work-based governance, work-backed assets, etc)

#### [Paizo](https://github.com/deadit/paizo)

> Live @ [deadit.github.io/paizo/](https://deadit.github.io/paizo/)
>
Paizo will be an on-chain mining governance simulation tool to help educate miners on how chain governance works. Currently, this information is highly technical and not intuitive to learn for the average user, so we want to make this information simple to understand so miners are empowered to make their voices heard on chain.


#### Ergo-payroll

Ergo-payroll will be an automated payroll distribution tool for ERGO. Enter your employees, enter the amount (count) in token or the amount of USD in token, enter frequency, and their wallets. Users only need to keep filling up the bank, and the system will take care of the rest.
