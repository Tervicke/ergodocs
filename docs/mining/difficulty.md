# Difficulty Adjustment in Ergo

> Leverage the [Difficulty & Epoch Monitor](https://cds.oette.info/ergo_diff.htm) to approximate the anticipated difficulty adjustments. 

Prior to the implementation of [EIP37](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/mining/standards/eip37/), Ergo's Autolykos protocol utilized a moderately paced difficulty adjustment mechanism in response to hash rate fluctuations. This method held a critical preventive role against adversarial hopping, with a 1.9% error compared to Bitcoin's 9.1%. The mechanic of adjustment is anchored in the linear least squares method which considers the past eight epochs (totalling 8,192 blocks) to estimate the difficulty function, as detailed in [this referenced paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/731.pdf). It aimed for a 120-second (or 2-minute) block interval during steady hash rate periods.

However, the system fell susceptible to massive hash rate increases across several epochs, particularly in cases displaying super-linear hash rate growth over time (as witnessed during the ETH merge). This susceptibility often led to extreme difficulty spikes. Conversely, periods of slow epochs could provoke a substantial difficulty drop. To resolve this, EIP37 was proposed and subsequently implemented. This proposal offered a more efficient and timely difficulty adjustment, relying on a shorter, recent block history thereby reducing the influence of abrupt hash rate changes. With the introduction of the EIP37 protocol, Ergo's mining process has become more resilient and secure against adversarial interferences.

**Why a 2-Minute Block Interval?**

The 2-minute target block interval in Ergo was chosen to provide a vital security buffer against a plethora of potential complications and attacks within a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency network that supports smart contracts. These potential issues encompass propagation delays, spam attacks, and verifier dilemmas, among others. A shorter block interval could leave the network vulnerable to Timewarp attacks â€” a difficulty manipulation attack causing blocks to be mined too quickly or too slowly. Furthermore, Ergo's epoch length approximates ~4.2 hours (assuming a normal block rate), which is a significant improvement from Bitcoin's two-week parameter. Overall, a 2-minute block interval provides a delicate equilibrium between ensuring network security and maintaining transaction speed, rendering Ergo an efficient and secure cryptocurrency tailored for daily use.
