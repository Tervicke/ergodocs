# Mining Pools

Mining pools are groups of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of finding a block. The reward is then split among the pool members, proportional to the amount of work they contributed. 

A comprehensive list of Ergo mining pools is available on [Mining Pool Stats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ergo). 

> To help maintain Ergo's decentralization, consider joining a smaller pool instead of the largest 2-3 pools.

## Earnings and Pool Size

While larger pools win blocks more frequently and can provide more consistent payouts, your long-term earnings should be roughly the same regardless of the pool size. In smaller pools, you might not receive a payout until the pool wins a block.

## Dual Mining

Dual mining allows you to mine Ergo alongside other coins such as KAS and ALPH. [Mining Pool Stats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ergo) provides details on pools currently offering this feature natively.

## Solo Pools

For miners who prefer to work independently, several solo pools are available. You can find a list of these on [Mining Pool Stats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ergo).

## SmartPools

[SmartPools](smartpools.md) are a decentralized alternative to traditional mining pools. They replace centralized mining pools with autonomous on-chain smart contracts. Keep an eye on [Lithos Protocol](lithos.md) for the next generation of these.
