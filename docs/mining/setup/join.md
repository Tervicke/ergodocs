# Start Mining

This guide will walk you through the process of starting to mine Ergo using [Autolykos2](autolykos.md). 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- [What is Ergo?](why.md)
- A computer equipped with at least one GPU that has more than 4GB of memory. You can refer to the [Autolykos v2 hashrates spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NsuoDB27EwCo_BlSjCP3GMLfTSJRPIWIBsL-wPTllUg) to get an estimate of potential hashrates.
- [Building a rig](rig.md)

## Steps to Start Mining

1. Choose your preferred [mining software](software.md). If you're using a dedicated rig, select an appropriate [operating system](os.md).
2. Set up a [wallet](wallet.md) where your mining payouts will be deposited.
3. Select a [mining pool](pools.md) to join. Mining in a pool can help you achieve more consistent returns.
4. Consider [overclocking](overclocking.md) your GPU to maximize your mining performance. Be aware that this can increase power consumption and potentially shorten the lifespan of your hardware.
5. Check out the [Miner Tooling](miner-tooling.md) and participate in [governance](governance.md)!

Happy mining!
