# Ergo Node

The Ergo Node is a critical component of Ergo's peer-to-peer network, responsible for hosting and synchronizing a copy of the entire blockchain. This page provides an overview of the Ergo Node, its installation options, and additional resources for developers.

To get an overview of live nodes on the Ergo network, you can visit [ergonodes.net](http://ergonodes.net).

## Should You Install the Node?

The Ergo Node is a crucial infrastructure piece that developers use to interact with the Ergo blockchain. If you're looking for a place to store your ERG tokens, you can explore the [wallets](wallets.md) page. Some wallets, such as [Satergo](https://satergo.com/), even offer the option to install a full node alongside their wallet application.

If you prefer to install the Ergo Node from scratch, you can refer to the [manual install](manual.md) page for detailed instructions. Alternatively, if you want to get started on the testnet, there is a dedicated [testnet](testnet.md) setup guide available.

For more convenience, Docker provides a streamlined way to install and run the Ergo Node. Refer to the [Docker](docker.md) guide for instructions on setting up the node using Docker. Even a [Raspberry Pi](pi.md) with a fast SSD attached is sufficient to sync and run a full node.
