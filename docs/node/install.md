The Ergo Node is part of Ergo's peer-to-peer network which hosts and synchronises a copy of the entire blockchain.

See an overview of live nodes at [ergonodes.net](http://ergonodes.net/) 

## **Should you install the node?**

The node is a critical piece of infrastructure developers use to interact with the chain. 

See the [wallets](/dev/wallets) page if you're just looking for a place to store your ERG, [Satergo](https://satergo.com/) even has the option to install a full node alongside it. 

To install from scratch please see the [manual install](manual.md) page, or get setup on the [testnet](testnet.md).

You can also use [Docker](docker.md), and even a [Raspberri Pi](pi.md) with a fast SSD attached is enough to sync a full node.
