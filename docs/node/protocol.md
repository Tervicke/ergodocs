# Node Protocol

The Node Protocol section provides a comprehensive overview of the Ergo network's core operational aspects. It covers the following key areas:

- **Processing Algorithm**: This part explains the algorithm used for processing Ergo [modifiers](modifiers-validation.md). It applies to all security modes within the Ergo network.

- **Validation Rules**: This section outlines the consensus-critical [validation](modifiers-validation.md) rules. Every node in the Ergo network must adhere to these rules to maintain network integrity and security.

- **P2P Protocol**: The [P2P Protocol](../dev/p2p/index.md) section provides details about the peer-to-peer protocol used in the Ergo network. It explains how nodes communicate and share information with each other.

- **Peer Management**: The [peer management](peer-management.md) part discusses how nodes in the Ergo network manage their peers. It includes information about peer discovery, connection, and disconnection.

By understanding these aspects, you can gain a deeper insight into how the Ergo network operates and maintains its security and efficiency.
