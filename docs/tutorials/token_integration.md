# Integration Guide for Bridging ERG Tokens

This guide provides a comprehensive approach to integrating and listing ERG tokens bridged to different networks, focusing on Ethereum, Cardano, and platform-specific analytics. Follow these steps to ensure your token is accurately recognized and accessible across various platforms and decentralized applications (dApps).

## General Integration Steps

### 1. CoinGecko

CoinGecko connects token data to multiple DeFi platforms. Listing here enhances visibility and accessibility across the ecosystem:

- **Submit a New Token Request**: Use the [CoinGecko Token Request Form](https://www.coingecko.com/request-form/tokens/new?locale=en) to input essential details, like the token contract address, symbol, and name.
- **Verification Guide**: Follow the [CoinGecko Verification Guide](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/23725417857817-Verification-Guide-for-Listing-Update-Requests-on-CoinGecko) to ensure your submission is accurate and meets listing criteria.

### 2. DEX Integration Checklist

Listing your bridged token on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) enables liquidity and trading. Each DEX has unique requirements for listing; however, general steps include:

- **Liquidity Pools**: Check each DEX’s documentation for specific pool requirements, such as initial liquidity contributions and associated fees.
- **Submit a Token Request**: Many DEXs use public GitHub repositories or online forms to process token requests. Verify that the token’s details align with the contract information.

## Network-Specific Integrations

### Ethereum

Ethereum-based platforms are essential for ERG tokens bridged to the Ethereum network:

#### Uniswap

1. **Liquidity Pool Setup**: Refer to the [Liquidity Guide](rsERGLP.md) for detailed steps on adding liquidity. Since gas fees vary significantly, check real-time gas prices on [ETH Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info/) to avoid excessive costs.
2. **Token Request on Uniswap**: Submit an issue to the [Uniswap Default Token List](https://github.com/Uniswap/default-token-list/issues/new?assignees=&labels=token+request&template=token-request.md&title=Add+%7BTOKEN_SYMBOL%7D%3A+%7BTOKEN_NAME%7D) GitHub repository. Ensure token details match the contract specifications.

#### Ethereum Analytics Platforms

Analytics platforms like Dexscreener and Dextools.io provide real-time data tracking for Ethereum-based tokens, enhancing visibility and attracting a larger user base:

- **Dexscreener**: Purchase [Enhanced Token Info](https://marketplace.dexscreener.com/product/token-info) for $299 to improve your token’s profile with additional metrics, links, and a more robust display.
- **Dextools.io Fast Track**: For quicker listing, use the Fast Track option by paying with $DEXT, $ETH, or $BNB via the [Dextools Fast Track Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1BAqjAl9nntlS2mOk76tE0Q-dEf-AT1bUblDXikjZ-PNP1Q/formResponse).

### Cardano

Integrating with Cardano platforms extends your token's reach within the Cardano ecosystem:

#### Taptools

Taptools tracks Cardano assets and supports token analytics. To list your bridged ERG token, reach out directly to Taptools through their website for specific listing steps.

#### Cardano DEXs

DEXs like Splash, Minswap, and WingRiders support bridged tokens. Visit [DeFiLlama’s Cardano section](https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano) to explore these DEXs and contact each platform individually for listing details.

#### Cardano Analytics Platforms

Cardano-focused analytics platforms can improve visibility by providing Cardano-based metrics and trading data for your token.
1. **Taptools.io**
2. **Cardanoscan**: Display real-time transaction data for bridged tokens on [Cardanoscan](https://cardanoscan.io/).
3. **AdaPulse**: AdaPulse covers Cardano asset updates and offers project-specific data for listed tokens.
