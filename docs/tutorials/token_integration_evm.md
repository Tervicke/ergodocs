# Integration Guide for Bridging ERG tokens

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the steps required to integrate and list tokens that have been bridged from ERG to ETH on various platforms. Follow these instructions to ensure your token is properly recognized and accessible across major platforms.

## CoinGecko Integration

To list your bridged token on CoinGecko, follow these steps:

- **Submit a New Token Request**: Visit the [CoinGecko Token Request Form](https://www.coingecko.com/request-form/tokens/new?locale=en) to submit your token details.
- **Verification Guide**: Refer to the [CoinGecko Verification Guide](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/23725417857817-Verification-Guide-for-Listing-Update-Requests-on-CoinGecko) for detailed instructions on the listing process.


## Ethereum

### Uniswap Integration

To list your token on Uniswap, follow these steps:

The process is similar to [adding liquidity](rsERGLP.md), but there are additional requirements for initializing a pool, which incurs gas fees. These fees can vary significantly, ranging from approximately 0.05 ETH during low traffic periods to much higher amounts during peak times so please make sure you aren't paying over the odds!

#### Updating Details

You can **File a Token Request**: Submit an issue on the [Uniswap Default Token List GitHub](https://github.com/Uniswap/default-token-list/issues/new?assignees=&labels=token+request&template=token-request.md&title=Add+%7BTOKEN_SYMBOL%7D%3A+%7BTOKEN_NAME%7D) with your token details. Ensure that token information such as decimals, symbol, and name is accurately reflected from the token contracts. 

Prioritizing a listing on CoinGecko is beneficial, as it serves as a data source for various platforms. Once listed, your token details will automatically propagate to multiple other services, reducing the need for additional manual updates.
