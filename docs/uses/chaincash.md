# ChainCash

Chaincash is a decentralized, peer-to-peer monetary system aimed at creating money collectively through trust and blockchain assets. The system addresses the issue of inelasticity in blockchain asset supply, which hinders the real-world usage of blockchain assets in many cases. Chaincash allows for the elastic creation of money in a decentralized manner while maintaining the quality of the currency.

Inspired by historical peer-to-peer monetary systems such as the WAT system, Chaincash uses gold as its unit of account. One Chaincash token represents approximately one milligram of gold. This system enables users to issue notes of arbitrary values, which may or may not be backed by reserves in various digital tokens or real-world assets.

To maintain the quality of the currency, acceptance of a note depends on the collateral or trust in the issuer. Participants can issue notes without any reserves, allowing for different collateralisation levels within various economic circles. As notes circulate, their quality generally improves due to the collective collateral and trust backing them.

Chaincash is implemented using two contracts on the Ergo blockchain: one for notes and one for reserves. The off-chain logic can track different note and reserve contracts, support various acceptance predicates and redemption mechanisms, and accommodate complementary currency systems such as Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) and local currencies.

Although Layer Two implementation is still under consideration, Chaincash offers a flexible and decentralized monetary system that can potentially cater to different economic agents globally, addressing the limitations of traditional blockchain assets.
