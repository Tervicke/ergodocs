# The Challenges and Risks of Implementing Flash Loans on Ergo

Flash loans, while gaining significant attention in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), primarily on Ethereum's account-based blockchain, have also been the root cause of numerous attacks. These loans, which allow users to borrow funds without collateral and return them within the same transaction, have not only revolutionized but also destabilized DeFi on account-based blockchains due to their inherent risks. Implementing them on eUTXO (Extended Unspent Transaction Output) blockchains poses several challenges and potential concerns.

## Use Cases of Flash Loans

While flash loans are primarily known for their role in arbitrage, their utility extends to other financial operations such as leverage, liquidity provision without the need for collateral, self-refinancing, and portfolio rebalancing. However, the community is divided on how useful these additional use-cases are.

> **Community Insight**: A question was raised about the absence of ACTs (Atomic Chained Transactions) in the Ergo ecosystem and whether they would be sufficient to enable flash loans. The discussion highlighted that ACTs would only support static outcomes, limiting the dynamic progression of transactions. This could be a limitation for flash loans, which often require dynamic interactions.



## Understanding UTXO and Its Distinctiveness

The [UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)](eutxo.md) model, which was first introduced by Bitcoin, operates [differently from account-based models like Ethereum](accountveutxo.md). In the UTXO model, transactions utilize unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) and generate new ones. This is a stark contrast to the account-based model, where smart contracts maintain a dynamic state that can be modified by other transactions within the same block. UTXO blockchains, on the other hand, necessitate that all computations be performed beforehand and incorporated into the transaction itself.

## Deterministic Nature of UTXO Blockchains

UTXO blockchains are deterministic, meaning all outcomes must be predictable before being added to the blockchain. This property conflicts with the inherently dynamic nature of flash loans, where one contract might depend on the outcome of another, all within the same transaction. You would need to predict the final state of all affected UTXOs beforehand, a near-impossible task given the real-time fluctuations in DeFi markets.

## Why Flash Loans Are Difficult on eUTXO 

### One Transaction, Many Steps

Flash loans usually involve multiple steps: borrowing funds, performing an action like arbitrage, and then repaying the loan, all within one transaction. In eUTXO blockchains, this would be highly impractical. Each 'step' would require its own transaction, which would have to be computed beforehand due to the deterministic nature of the model.

### Cross-Protocol Interactions Are Complex

Flash loans often require interacting with multiple DeFi protocols rapidly. In eUTXO systems, this would mean packaging multiple UTXOs, from various protocols, into a single transaction. Calculating all these in advance would be complex and computationally intensive.

### No Guarantees of Atomic Execution Within a Block

Flash loans are designed to be [atomic](atomic-composability.md)â€”either the whole chain of transactions is completed, or none are. This is straightforward in account-based blockchains where multiple interactions can occur within the same block. However, eUTXO blockchains do not offer such guarantees, making it risky if a multi-step flash loan transaction spans across multiple blocks.

> **Community Insight**: The discussion among Ergo developers touched upon the possibility of introducing atomicity through a soft fork by using a special ID context variable. This would allow the flash loan provider contract to enforce the chain of transactions, adding a layer of security and predictability.

## Potential Workarounds and Considerations

### Data Inputs

[Data inputs](read-only-inputs.md), a unique feature in Ergo's UTXO model, allow transactions to reference existing UTXOs and read their data without consuming them. This feature can be leveraged to address some of the limitations associated with flash loans in eUTXO systems by allowing multiple transactions within a block or slot to read the data from the same UTXO concurrently.

### Multi-Stage Contracts

[Multi-stage contracts](multi.md) offer a way to work around some of these limitations. These contracts allow a series of transactions to be 'chained' together, emulating more complex, multi-step processes. They can hold interim states and even facilitate parallelized actions.

1. **Interim State Management**: These contracts can 'remember' a partial state, enabling a more complex, sequenced series of transactions, somewhat simulating a flash loan's multi-step process.
   
2. **Complex Logic and Parallel Actions**: These contracts can also facilitate more complex transaction logic, and even actions in parallel, which is closer to how flash loans operate on account-based blockchains.

**Challenges of Multi-Stage Contracts**

1. **Still No Atomicity**: While these contracts can enable complex transactions, they can't guarantee that these will all be processed in the same block, a fundamental feature of flash loans.
  
2. **High Complexity, High Risk**: The more complex the system, the higher the likelihood of security risks, particularly in financial operations like flash loans.

### Forking for Atomicity

Implementing atomicity in chained transactions is a complex issue that has been discussed within the Ergo developer community. There are different approaches to achieve this, each with its own set of challenges and implications.


#### Hard Fork Approach

One way to enable atomicity is through a hard-fork extension. This would involve extending the transaction serialization format to include a special extensions section for each transaction. Transactions could then be marked as belonging to a chain, forcing all miners to either accept the entire chain or reject it. This approach would be a significant change and would require community consensus for implementation.

#### Soft Fork Alternative

An alternative could be a soft fork, which would be less disruptive to the existing network. By using a special ID context variable, the flash loan provider contract could enforce the chain of transactions. This would not only require introducing a new transaction extension but also injecting this extension into the execution context. The soft fork approach could be a potentially less disruptive way to introduce atomicity for flash loans.

> **Community Insight**: The soft fork approach was also discussed among the community members. It was suggested that this could be a viable way to introduce atomicity in flash loans on Ergo. However, this would also require injecting the new transaction extension into the execution context, adding another layer of complexity.

Both approaches aim to solve the issue of atomicity in flash loans and come with their own sets of challenges. Regardless of the approach taken, community consensus will be crucial for implementation.

### Risks and Ethical Considerations

Flash loans have been used to exploit various protocols, draining their reserves and destabilizing the ecosystem. A [paper from 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03810.pdf) details these kinds of attacks.

> **Community Insight**: There is skepticism within the Ergo developer community about the ethical implications of implementing flash loans. Concerns were raised about the risk of attacks and the potential for manipulating on-chain oracles if the core protocol were modified to support flash loans. Some members expressed that flash loans could make exploits more accessible and also create incentives for coordinated manipulations. However, others argued that flash loans could attract more users to Ergo and test the integrity of its protocols.


## Conclusion

The eUTXO model inherently promotes transaction security and predictability at the cost of some functionalities that are easier to implement in account-based systems, such as flash loans. While weak blocks and multi-stage contracts offer interesting workarounds, they do not fully address the challenges and risks posed by implementing flash loans in eUTXO blockchains.

> **Community Insight**: The general sentiment among Ergo developers is cautionary when it comes to implementing flash loans on the Ergo platform. Concerns range from technical challenges to ethical implications, making it a complex issue that requires careful consideration. The discussion also highlighted the potential for flash loans to test the integrity of Ergo's protocols, but at the risk of making exploits more accessible.
